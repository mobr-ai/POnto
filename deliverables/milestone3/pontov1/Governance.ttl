    rdfs:label "Treasury" ;
    rdfs:comment "A pool of funds that is used to support the development and maintenance of the Polkadot ecosystem." ;

ponto:Governance a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Governance" ;
    rdfs:comment "The process of determining what changes to the network are permissible, such as modifications to code or movement of funds. The governance system in Polkadot is on-chain and revolves around stakeholder voting." ;

ponto:OnchainGovernance a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "On-chain Governance" ;
    rdfs:comment "A governance system of a blockchain that is controlled by mechanisms on the blockchain. On-chain governance allows decisions to be made transparently. Note that there are a variety of different algorithms for making these decisions, such as simple majority voting, adaptive quorum biasing, or identity-based quadratic voting." ;

ponto:OpenGov a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "OpenGov" ;
    rdfs:comment "Previously known as Governance v2 (Gov2) during early development, Polkadot OpenGov serves as the current governance protocol for both Kusama and Polkadot." ;

ponto:Council a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Council" ;
    rdfs:comment "An on-chain entity that consists of several on-chain accounts (starting at 6, eventually moving to the final value of 24). The Council can act as a representative for "passive" (non-voting) stakeholders. Council members have two main tasks: proposing referenda for the overall stakeholder group to vote on and cancelling malicious referenda." ;

ponto:Proposal a owl:Class ;

    rdfs:comment "A potential function call to be voted on in a referendum. Proposals modify the behavior of the Polkadot network, from minor parameter tuning up to replacing the runtime code." ;

ponto:Bounty a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Bounty" ;
    rdfs:comment "A mechanism which works in some sense as the reverse of a Treasury Proposal, allowing the Polkadot Council to indicate that there is a need to do some task for the Polkadot network and allowing users to receive DOT in return for working on that task." ;

ponto:Curator a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Curator" ;

ponto:Referendum a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Referendum" ;
    rdfs:comment "A vote on whether or not a proposal should be accepted by the network. Referenda may be initiated by the Governance Council, by a member of the public, or as the result of a previous proposal. Stakeholders vote on referenda, weighted by both the size of their stake (i.e. number of DOT held) and the amount of time they are willing to lock their tokens." ;

ponto:Motion a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Motion" ;

ponto:tabling a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:label "Tabling" ;
