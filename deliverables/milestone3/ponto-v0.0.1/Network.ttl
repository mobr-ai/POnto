    rdfs:comment "Re-Genesis is the process of exporting the current chain state, and creating a new chain that builds on it. Re-Genesis will involve stop-the-world migration, which results in a period of time when no actual blocks are added to the blockchain. In a way, re-genesis can be viewed as a hard fork process.

ponto:HardFork a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Hard Fork" ;
    rdfs:comment "A permanent diversion of a blockchain occurs quickly due to a high priority change in a consensus rule.

ponto:SoftFork a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Soft Fork" ;
    rdfs:comment "A backward compatible change to client code causes upgraded clients to start mining a new chain. Requires a 'vote-by-hashrate' of a majority of miners to enact successfully. Soft forks are considered temporary divergences in a chain since non-upgraded clients do not follow the new consensus rules but upgraded clients are still compatible with old consensus rules." ;
